## Mechanics

In this game the player can move back and forth through several locations for a multitude of
activities. The quest of the player, to return home without having changed the past and thus
the future, can be completed by interacting with NPCs, solving missions and doing puzzles
of various kinds. Helping others and paying attention to the surroundings will be rewarded in
the game.
As the game is aimed at touch screen devices such as mobile phones and tablets, the
interaction with the game will be via touch screen motions. The player can interact with the
6
elements on the screen, they can collect objects into their inventory and move around in
areas by holding one of the two direction buttons.
